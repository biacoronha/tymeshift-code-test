# Tymeshift react-code-test

This project was developed as part of Tymeshift's coding challenge.
The goal was to create a small application based on the specs and designs provided.

I tried my best to make it as similar to what was provided as possible, however, I'm not sure if the font is the correct one.
I saw on sketch that the font used was 'Lato', so I installed it in my project.
