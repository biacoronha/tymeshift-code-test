# Tymeshift react-code-test

This project was developed as part of Tymeshift's coding challenge: https://github.com/Tymeshift/react-code-test

The goal was to create a small application in React based on the specs and designs provided.

I created this application as similar to what was provided as I could, trying to develop a clean code, with easy to undestand structure and tests for all the components

# How-to

This application runs in localhost:3000 and the only thing to do to run it is
```
npm start
```


To run the tests, the command is
```
npm test
```
